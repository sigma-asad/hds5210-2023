* 5 points - Uses data from at least two different sources: local file, internet, web service, relational database, AWS S3, etc; and formats: CSV, JSON, database, XML, Excel, etc
* 5 points - Data from multiple sources has to be joined together at least twice
* 5 points - Data is aggregated or pivoted at least twice during the program
* 5 points - Some kind of field-level transformation is performed at least 5 times
* 5 points - The program creates 3 or more data visualizations 
* 5 points - The program serves a theoretical purpose described in documentation, that could potentially do something in healthcare or another industry of interest

**Modularity / Style**
* 15 points - The code is broken up into various functions or classes to make testing and reuse easier

**Documentation and Professionalism**
* 15 points - All functions are documented and notebook cells include annotations and explanations.


**(-1) Your project should have opened with some kind of documentation and explanation of the project.  You immediately start reading data and we don't even know why.**

**That heatmap is an interesting way to visualize NAs**

**(-1) Plotting deaths and beds on teh same chart doesn't give you much opportunity to compare because they're at such different scales.  Besides, a line chart by State is a bad way to see that data.  A scatter plot of deaths vs beds would have been much better.**

**(-3) You only performed one join/merge.  Two were required for full credit.**

**(-3) You only used CSV input files.  Two different file types were required for full credit.**

**Overall, I think your project was OK.  The datasets you chose were limited in scale and variety, leading to a lower overall score.**
